Project Overview:
This project is an AI-powered Health Recommendation System designed to assist users by taking symptoms as input and providing possible health conditions, recommended precautions, and personalized diet plans. It aims to support early awareness and self-care.

Objective:
To build an interactive system that:

Accepts symptoms from the user via a web interface

Predicts the most likely health condition

Recommends precautions and suitable diet plans

Enhances health awareness and accessibility for users

System Features:

Symptom-based input (via form or chatbot interface)

Instant output including condition name, description, precautions, and dietary advice

Editable fields for user verification before final submission

Can be extended to multilingual and voice-based input in future

Tech Stack Used:

Programming Language: Python

Interface: Streamlit

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Backend Logic: Rule-based and symptom mapping

Deployment: Localhost (can be hosted on cloud for production)

How the System Works:

User enters their symptoms in the text field

Backend maps symptoms to conditions using a predefined logic or dataset

The system displays possible diagnosis along with:

Description of the condition

Suggested precautions

Recommended diet plans

The user can modify or download this report

Dataset:
A structured dataset of common symptoms and their mapped health conditions, associated precautions, and diets. The data is cleaned and verified for accuracy.

Outcome:
Successfully developed a simple yet effective health assistant that can support users in identifying potential health issues and guide them with next steps and lifestyle tips. Can be scaled with AI-based classification and multilingual support.

Learning Highlights:

Built real-world logic-driven applications in Python

Learned symptom mapping and recommendation systems

Hands-on experience with user interface design using Streamlit

Gained understanding of user-centered health tech applications
